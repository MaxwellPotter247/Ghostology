                        <p>True paranormal stories told by a real ghost hunter from extremely haunted locations.

                            A cursed bed in an attic, an invisible man at an abandoned hotel, and a shadow demon above
                            an Ouija board--these are just a few of the authentic experiences described by paranormal
                            investigator Scott Brian. With a degree in archaeology, Scott has over a decade researching
                            haunting encounters with apparitions and other ghostly phenomena. From poltergeist like
                            activity to the occult, Scott uses methods and techniques brrowed from traditional science
                            to study the unexplained.

                            Now Scott tells of his most thrilling and mysterious investigations over the past ten years.
                            Haunted houses, ghosts, spirits and other supernatural entities are just some of the topics
                            covered in Ghostology: Ghostly Attacks. Unlike other paranormal books, the Ghostology series
                            goes beyond a carnival thrill ride, documenting real-life hauntings to research the
                            afterlife.  <br> <a style=color:#8b0b0b href="https://www.amazon.com/Ghostology-Ghostly-Attacks-Paranormal-Investigation-ebook/dp/B07HLSC855/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=ghostology+scott+brian&qid=1625766604&sr=8-2" target="_blank">Buy Now On Amazon!</a></p></p>

                    <div class="books-2">
                        <p>March 3, 1863 President Abraham Lincoln signed an act of congress creating the Idaho
                            Territory which encompassed the modern states of Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming. Life was not
                            easy though in the newly formed territory. Lawlessness, crime, and hostilities with the
                            area’s Native Americans were common, but this did not stop thousands of people from many
                            places, cultures, and ethnicities migrating to the Idaho Territory. Most were looking for
                            riches in the mining industries of the time, others followed the expansion of the railroads,
                            and some were searching for place to call home. What every migrant discovered were the
                            rugged landscape of the desert west and the unforgiving heights of the Rocky Mountains.
                            Violence, disease, and death were frequently found in the territory. The dangers of the
                            1800s and early 1900s were harsh in the Idaho Territory. Stories of accidents, illnesses,
                            and murders seem to fill its early cemeteries. From mining disasters, smallpox epidemics,
                            homicidal bandits, and vigilante mobs there were many ways territorial residents could die
                            any given day. It should be no surprise that the ghost towns, railways, and scenic
                            landscapes of the former Idaho Territory are rumored to be haunted. The spirits of the
                            former residents don’t seem to want to forgotten. Scott V. Brian, paranormal investigator
                            and trained archaeologist has spent over a decade researching and investigating some of the
                            most haunted places in the former Idaho Territory. He is excited to continue telling his
                            most terrifying findings in Ghostology: Tales from a Decade of Paranormal Investigation,
                            Volume Two. This next volume of the Ghostology series is dedicated to the haunting tales

                            real hauntings, then Ghostology: Based on Actual Events will take you on thrilling

                            collection of stories are based on real people and their experiences written in story form
                            for maximum enjoyment. In 2007, author and paranormal investigator, Scott Brian, founded the
                            Southeast Idaho Paranormal Organization. For over a decade, he has investigated reported
                            hauntings all over Idaho and surrounding states. Beyond his own research, Scott has also
                            collected numerous first-hand accounts of ghostly encounters and paranormal activity. Now in
                            this series, he will share some of the most electrifying and terrifying tales told to him by
                            the actual witnesses to the paranormal. Ghostology: Based on Actual Events is a collection
                            of real paranormal experiences, fictionalized and retold in story form. Though the names and
                            some details have been changed, the ghostly events described in each story have been written
                            to reflect true encounters with the unknown. The first book in this series, Haunted Youth,
                            focuses on stories that center around children who have experienced ghostly visitations or
                            even demonic disturbances. The children and their interactions with the supernatural range
                            from imaginary friends, to ghostly disturbances, and even the occult. The stories in this
                            book are for everyone of all ages who are looking for the ghost stories of children. But
                            beware, because even though characters are fiction, the ghosts are real! <br> <a style=color:#8b0b0b href="https://www.amazon.com/Ghostology-Based-Actual-Events-Haunted-ebook/dp/B07XMBDM29/ref=sr_1_5?dchild=1&keywords=ghostology+scott+brian&qid=1625766709&sr=8-5" target="_blank">Buy Now On Amazon!</a></p>
